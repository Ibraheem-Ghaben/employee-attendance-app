## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Workday with Overtime
**Configuration:**
- Workday: 09:00-17:00
- OT starts: 17:00
- Regular: $20/hr
- Weekday OT: 1.5× = $30/hr

**Punches:** 08:55 IN, 18:30 OUT

**Result:**
- Regular: 8.0 hrs × $20 = **$160.00**
- Weekday OT: 1.5 hrs × $30 = **$45.00**
- **Total: $205.00**

### Example 2: Weekend Work
**Configuration:**
- Weekend: Friday-Saturday
- Regular: $20/hr
- Weekend OT: 2.0× = $40/hr

**Punches (Friday):** 10:00 IN, 16:00 OUT

**Result:**
- Weekend OT: 6.0 hrs × $40 = **$240.00**

### Example 3: Full Week
| Day | Type | Hours | Regular | Weekday OT | Weekend OT | Pay |
|-----|------|-------|---------|------------|------------|-----|
| Mon | Work | 9.0 | 8.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | $190 |
