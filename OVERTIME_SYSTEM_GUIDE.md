# üìä Overtime & Pay Tracking System

## Overview

The Employee Attendance App now includes a comprehensive **Weekly Calendar & 3-Bucket Overtime System** that automatically calculates and tracks:

- **Regular Hours** (workday hours within normal schedule)
- **Weekday Overtime** (hours after OT start time on workdays)
- **Weekend Overtime** (all hours worked on weekend days)

---

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Flexible Weekly Calendar Configuration**
- Define custom week start (Sunday, Monday, etc.)
- Configure weekend days per site (e.g., Friday-Saturday or Saturday-Sunday)
- Set workday hours (start/end)
- Define overtime start time

### 2. **3-Bucket Pay Calculation**
```
Regular Pay      = (Regular Minutes / 60) √ó Regular Rate
Weekday OT Pay   = (Weekday OT Minutes / 60) √ó Weekday OT Rate
Weekend OT Pay   = (Weekend OT Minutes / 60) √ó Weekend OT Rate
Total Daily Pay  = Regular + Weekday OT + Weekend OT
```

### 3. **Flexible Rate Configuration**
- **Fixed Rate**: Specify exact hourly rate for OT
- **Multiplier**: Use multiplier (e.g., 1.5√ó or 2.0√ó) based on regular rate

### 4. **Automated Calculation**
- Pairs IN/OUT punches automatically
- Splits worked time into appropriate buckets
- Calculates pay for each bucket
- Stores daily breakdown with audit trail

### 5. **Weekly Reports with Excel Export**
- View weekly summaries by employee
- Daily breakdown with all 3 buckets
- Export to Excel for payroll processing

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Schema

```bash
cd /home/administrator/employee_attendance_app/backend
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P YourPassword -i overtime_schema.sql
```

Or using SQL Server Management Studio:
- Open `backend/overtime_schema.sql`
- Execute against your SQL Server instance

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

```sql
USE AttendanceAuthDB;
SELECT * FROM dbo.EmployeePayConfig;
SELECT * FROM dbo.SitePayConfig;
SELECT * FROM dbo.TimesheetDays;
```

### Step 3: Configure Employee Pay Settings

The schema creates default configurations for test employees (080001, 080165, 080416).

To add/update configurations, use the API:

```bash
POST /api/overtime/config/080165
{
  "pay_type": "Hourly",
  "hourly_rate_regular": 20.00,
  "weekday_ot_rate_type": "multiplier",
  "weekday_ot_multiplier": 1.5,
  "weekend_ot_rate_type": "multiplier",
  "weekend_ot_multiplier": 2.0,
  "week_start": "Sunday",
  "weekend_days": "Friday,Saturday",
  "workday_start": "09:00:00",
  "workday_end": "17:00:00",
  "ot_start_time_on_workdays": "17:00:00",
  "minimum_daily_hours_for_pay": 6.0

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Workday with Overtime

**Configuration:**
- Workday: 09:00 - 17:00
- OT starts: 17:00
- Regular rate: $20/hr
- Weekday OT: 1.5√ó = $30/hr

**Punches:**
- IN: 08:55
- OUT: 18:30

**Calculation:**
- Regular: 09:00-17:00 = 8.0 hours = $160.00
- Weekday OT: 17:00-18:30 = 1.5 hours = $45.00
- Weekend OT: 0 hours = $0.00
- **Total: $205.00**

### Example 2: Weekend Work

**Configuration:**
- Weekend days: Friday, Saturday
- Regular rate: $20/hr
- Weekend OT: 2.0√ó = $40/hr

**Punches (Friday):**
- IN: 10:00
- OUT: 16:00

**Calculation:**
- Regular: 0 hours = $0.00
- Weekday OT: 0 hours = $0.00
- Weekend OT: 6.0 hours = $240.00
- **Total: $240.00**

### Example 3: Mixed Week

| Day | Type | Hours | Regular | Weekday OT | Weekend OT | Pay |

  --output weekly_report.xlsx
```

## üìä Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Run `overtime_schema.sql` to create tables
   - Configure default site settings
   - Set up employee pay configurations

2. **Daily Operations**
   - Employees punch IN/OUT as usual
   - System stores raw punch data

3. **Calculation**
   - Admin/Supervisor triggers calculation (manual or scheduled)
   - System pairs punches, calculates buckets, computes pay
   - Results stored in `TimesheetDays`

4. **Reporting**
   - View weekly reports via API or UI
   - Export to Excel for payroll processing
   - Audit trail maintained with rates used

5. **Adjustments**
   - Update employee rates as needed
   - Recalculate with `force_recalculate: true`
   - Review calculation errors if any

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Calculation Errors

Check the `TimesheetDays` table for errors:

```sql
SELECT employee_code, work_date, calculation_error
FROM dbo.TimesheetDays
WHERE is_calculated = 0 AND calculation_error IS NOT NULL;
```

Common issues:
- Missing pay configuration
- Invalid rate configuration (multiplier without value)
- No punch data for date

### Recalculate Failed Days

```bash
POST /api/overtime/calculate/080165
{
  "from_date": "2025-01-05",
  "to_date": "2025-01-05",
  "force_recalculate": true
}
```

---

## üìù Notes

- Punch times are paired as IN ‚Üí OUT based on chronological order
- Unpaired punches (missing IN or OUT) may result in calculation errors
- Weekend determination is based on `weekend_days` configuration
- Pay rates used during calculation are stored for audit purposes
- Recalculation overwrites previous results

---

## üéâ Next Steps

Now that the overtime system is set up:

1. ‚úÖ Database schema created
2. ‚úÖ Backend services implemented
3. ‚úÖ API endpoints exposed
4. üìù TODO: Build frontend UI components
5. üìù TODO: Add unit tests
6. üìù TODO: Set up scheduled calculation job (optional)

Refer to the frontend implementation guide for building the UI components!
