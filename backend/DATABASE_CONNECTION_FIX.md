# 🔧 Database Connection Pool Isolation Fix

## ⚠️ The Problem

You reported that database connections were getting mixed up - requests intended for one database were going to another database. This was causing:

```
Invalid object name 'dbo.Users'
```

Even though the authentication code was correctly using `getLocalConnection()`.

---

## 🐛 Root Cause

The issue was with **connection pool isolation**. Both database configurations were using:

```typescript
pool = await sql.connect(config);  // ❌ Uses global connection!
```

This approach uses a **global connection pool** in the `mssql` module, which caused:
- Connection state to be shared between databases
- Queries intended for `AttendanceAuthDB` being sent to `MSS_TA`
- Queries intended for `MSS_TA` being sent to `AttendanceAuthDB`
- Unpredictable behavior based on which database was accessed last

---

## ✅ The Fix

Changed both database connection files to use **dedicated connection pool instances**:

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
pool = await sql.connect(config);  // ❌ Global pool
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
pool = new sql.ConnectionPool(config);  // ✅ Dedicated instance
await pool.connect();
```

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### 1. `/backend/src/config/database.ts` (MSS_TA Database)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Creates dedicated `ConnectionPool` instance
- ✅ Proper connection state checking
- ✅ Graceful handling of disconnected pools
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Clear logging: "Connected to MSS_TA Database"

### 2. `/backend/src/config/localDatabase.ts` (AttendanceAuthDB)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Creates dedicated `ConnectionPool` instance
- ✅ Completely isolated from MSS_TA pool
- ✅ Proper connection state checking
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Clear logging: "Connected to Local Auth Database"

```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Each database has its **own dedicated connection pool**
- ✅ No shared state between databases
- ✅ Queries always go to the correct database
- ✅ Connection isolation guaranteed

## 🔍 Connection Lifecycle

### MSS_TA Database (Employee/Attendance Data):

```typescript
1. Service calls getConnection()
2. Check if pool exists and is connected
   - Yes → Return existing pool
   - No → Create new ConnectionPool instance
3. Connect to MSS_TA database
4. Log: "✓ Connected to MSS_TA Database"
5. Return isolated pool instance
```

### AttendanceAuthDB (Authentication Data):

```typescript
1. Service calls getLocalConnection()
2. Check if localPool exists and is connected
   - Yes → Return existing localPool
   - No → Create new ConnectionPool instance
3. Connect to AttendanceAuthDB database
4. Log: "✓ Connected to Local Auth Database"
5. Return isolated localPool instance
```

**Result:** Each database maintains its own connection pool with no interference!

## 📊 Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Connection Isolation** | ❌ Shared global pool | ✅ Dedicated pools |
| **Query Routing** | ❌ Unpredictable | ✅ Always correct |
| **Connection State** | ❌ Mixed | ✅ Isolated |
| **Error Handling** | ❌ Basic | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Logging** | ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific per DB |
| **Reliability** | ❌ Flaky | ✅ Stable |

---

## 🧪 Testing

After the fix, you should see in logs:

```
✓ Connected to Local Auth Database: localhost / AttendanceAuthDB
✓ Connected to MSS_TA Database: APIC-APP02 / MSS_TA
```

This confirms both databases are connected independently.

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Logs on Startup

```bash
npm start
```

Should show:
```
✓ Connected to Local Auth Database: localhost / AttendanceAuthDB
✓ Connected to MSS_TA Database: APIC-APP02 / MSS_TA
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

### 2. Test Authentication (Local DB)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"MSS@2024"}'
```

Should query `AttendanceAuthDB.Users` table successfully.

### 3. Test Employee Data (Remote DB)

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/profile/list/all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Should query `MSS_TA.Laserfiche` table successfully.

### 4. Confirm No Cross-Contamination

- ✅ Login queries go to `AttendanceAuthDB`
- ✅ Employee queries go to `MSS_TA`
- ✅ No "Invalid object name" errors
- ✅ Each database receives only its intended queries

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Connection Pool Configuration

Both pools use the same settings:
```typescript
pool: {
  max: 10,              // Maximum 10 connections
  min: 0,               // Minimum 0 connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000  // Close idle connections after 30s
}
```

### Connection Reuse

- Pools are reused across requests (efficient)
- Each pool connects only to its designated database
- Idle connections are automatically closed
- Reconnection is handled automatically if needed

### Error Handling

Both connection functions now:
- ✅ Check if pool is connected before reusing
- ✅ Close disconnected pools gracefully
- ✅ Create fresh pool instances when needed
- ✅ Provide clear error messages
- ✅ Include database name in logs

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem:** Database connection pools were mixing up - queries went to wrong databases

**Root Cause:** Global `sql.connect()` caused shared connection state

**Solution:** Create dedicated `ConnectionPool` instances per database

**Result:** 
- ✅ Complete connection isolation
- ✅ Reliable query routing
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Clear logging

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Each database now has its own isolated connection pool!
